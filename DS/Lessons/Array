Array-

Array is a data structure which is used to store simmilar kind of data types in a sequential manner.

Arrays can be used-

> To Perform sorting (Bubble sort, Merge Sort,insertion sort, etc..
> in CPU scheduling.
> in Recursive functions.

Pros-
Access to an element is fast,  using element index
No need for boundary check i.e no wastage of computation time.


Cons-
Insertion or deletion in between the array is costly, because each element needs to be shifted after the inserted or deleted element.
